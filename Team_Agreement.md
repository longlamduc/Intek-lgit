PROJECT LGIT

Team member: ldlong, kmduy

Our total working hours: about 25-30 hours for each member

We share the parts of the project and check orthers' code each 3 hours


Our strength and weakness:
	kmduy:
		Strengths: He unserstands the concept of lgit and know what to do from the beginning, he is good at dividing the works and controlling the workflow
		Weakness: He gets stuck in some pycodestyle mistakes and needs time to fix hem
	ldlong:
		Strengths: He can follow the workflow of the project and can write code with less pycodestyle problem.
		Weakness: He doesn't have a strength in planning and controlling the workflow
	How to leverage/ liminate each member strengths/weakness: We decide that kmduy will write the plan for the project step by step and time to finish each part of lgit, ldlong will test and find some cases that git have to do and then discuss to each other to come to the final decision.


The allocation of the workload: 
	In the first four days of the first week, we will try to finish the simple commands such as lgit init, lgit config, lgit rm and lgit add.
	In the first weekend, we solve the special case and fix the error if any.
	In the second week, we will try to finish the other commands such as lgit commit, lgit ls-files, lgit status and lgit log.
	To have it more clearly, kmduy will work in lgit init, add, rm and log and ls-files and ldlong will finish lgit config, commit, status and ls-files functions. 
	Unfortunately, our work is not completed as planned. We cannot solve the first week's problem because we got stuck in some test case but everything is finished on Thursday of the second week.


After finishing our functions, we discuss our idea with each other to improcve the code and then test it to satisfy all the cases. After discussing, we all know the idea of the code.
